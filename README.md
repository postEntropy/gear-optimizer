# Gear Optimizer (Enhanced)

This is a fork / enhanced version of the original **Gear Optimizer** project by [gmiclotte](https://github.com/gmiclotte/gear-optimizer).

The goal of this version is to improve **readability, decision-making, and optimization clarity**, especially for late-game scenarios.

## What’s New

### 🔢 Improved Sorting
- Added sorting by **Bonus Change** for **NGUs**:
  - Normal NGUs
  - Evil NGUs
- Added sorting by **Bonus Change** for **Hacks**

This makes it much easier to quickly identify which upgrades provide the highest marginal benefit.

### 📊 Percentage Change Display
- Each **Bonus Change** now shows the **percentage impact** next to it.
- Helps visually compare efficiency instead of relying only on raw multipliers.

### 🧭 Quality-of-Life Improvements
- Faster comparison between options
- Better overview of diminishing returns
- More intuitive optimization flow, especially when multiple upgrades compete for resources
